# PROJECT PROBLEMS
#### Author: Nam Tran

Congratulations! If you can read this, then that means you understand how to open a plain text file, and therefore knows at least a bit about coding and how to open a file on GitHub. 

Or you could have very well stumbled on this by accident. In which case I politely ask you to turn this in to the programmer in charge of continuing this project, and please forget you saw this.

This file will outline the glaring problems that exists within this project, and how YOU can make it better. Why can't I fix it myself, you ask? Good question. Since I only have 7 weeks to build this project from scratch, as well as learning how to be a full-stack web developer, on top of which I am not getting paid for, I feel like big, gaping, throbbing problems are inevitable. 


If you understand this and decided that you still want to work on this project, please read on.

## ON THE PROJECT AS A WHOLE

This project was cobbled and held together using WD-40 and duct tape, with some Gorrila glue mixed in, and is intended for use within Seven Hills Foundation. While we tried our best we could, please keep in mind that: 
    1. __We are not CS majors:__ I am an Robotics Engineering major, and my colleague Mike is in Aerospace Engineering. While both of us can code to some extents, we will not have a CS degree when we graduate.

    2. __We are not web developers:__ While I have built a total of one web application in the past, in a web development course, I did not touch any of the front end design, and everything I've learned about that was on the fly. My colleague Mike only have experience during one database course he took.


    3. __We are not getting paid__: True, asking to get paid by doing work for a non-profit organization is not a good idea, and may seem unethical of me. I enjoy working for this, but unpaid developers, as study shown, tend to have a lower-quality end product than paid ones. So I would strongly recommend hiring a team of developers if someone were to use this project seriously in any professional capacity.


    4. __We are not a dev team:__ What I mean is, we are not a full on development team. Mike is in charge of getting the MySQL database running smoothly, and I am in charge of the full stack web application. We don't have Q/A, Tester, or a Project Manager. Just the two of us. So please keep this in mind when maintaining the project.


    5. __We are short on time:__ We only have 7 weeks for this project, 2 of weeks were spent on designing, since we are not alllowed to start working sooner. I am probably not going to work on this anymore after this term has ended, which means this project is doomed to end, unless it gains popularity within Seven Hills Foundation, and needs maintaining, in which I will be glad to help out whoever is in charge of continuing this project. 

    
    6. __We are working on another project:__ At the same time, we are also working on a full fledged final report paper, a video, along with training and survey at the same time. While I have the opportunity to work on the project most of the time, this reduces the number of working developer down to one. 
    

These are just some thoughts I have while working on this project at approx. 4am. If any of my teammates read this, please make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands. And don't be mad at me.
